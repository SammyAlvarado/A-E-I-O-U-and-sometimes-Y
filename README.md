Challenge

"A, E, I, O, U, and sometimes Y..."

Write a function called numberOfVowels(in string: String) that returns the count of the total number of vowels in a string. Your solution should be case-insensitive, and allow for 'Y' to be included, or excluded from the count when calling the function.

Example: numberOfVowels(in: "Polly wants a cracker!", isYAVowel = true) // returns 6
